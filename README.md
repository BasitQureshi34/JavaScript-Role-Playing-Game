# JavaScript Role-Playing Game

This is a simple text-based role-playing game (RPG) developed using JavaScript. The project was completed as part of the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures Certification course.

## Overview

In this project, we've built a basic RPG game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game features various locations, monsters, weapons, and interactions that the player can engage with.

## Features

- **Locations**: The game includes different locations such as the town square, store, cave, and fight scenes.
- **Monsters**: There are three types of monsters: slime, fanged beast, and dragon, each with different levels of difficulty and health points.
- **Weapons**: The player can acquire different weapons from the store to increase their attack power.
- **Health and Gold**: The player's character has health and gold attributes which change throughout the game based on actions taken.
- **Combat System**: Players can engage in combat with monsters, choosing between attacking, dodging, or running away.
- **Experience Points**: Players earn experience points (XP) and gold when defeating monsters, which can be used to purchase items or upgrade weapons.
- **Easter Egg**: The game features a hidden easter egg mini-game where the player can guess a number for rewards.
